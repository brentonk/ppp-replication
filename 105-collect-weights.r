## Rename the stored object

## The natural name is "trained_weights," to pair with "trained_models," but of
## course that's what each of the component parts was originally named in
## 15-train-weights.r, hence why we need this renaming hack to avoid collision
## problems.  Could get around it by loading into an environment other than the
## global one, but not really worth all that trouble
