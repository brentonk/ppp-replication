\section{Dispute Outcome Expectations (DOE) Scores}

\subsection{predict-dir-dyad.csv and predict-dyad.csv}

The files \texttt{predict-dir-dyad.csv} and \texttt{predict-dyad.csv} contain the Dispute Outcome Expectations measures whose construction is described in the article.
They contain observations on all dyad-years (directed and undirected, respectively) from 1816 to 2007, according to the Correlates of War Project's State System Membership data.

Both datasets contain the same variables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{ccode\_a}: Correlates of War code for Country A.
  \item \texttt{ccode\_b}: Correlates of War code for Country B.
  \item \texttt{year}: Year of observation.
  \item \texttt{VictoryB}: Estimated probability of victory by Country B.
  \item \texttt{Stalemate}: Estimated probability of stalemate.
  \item \texttt{VictoryA}: Estimated probability of victory by Country A.  Always equals $1 - \mathtt{VictoryB} - \mathtt{Stalemate}$.
\end{itemize}

In the directed data, Country A is assumed to be the initiator and Country B is assumed to be the target of the hypothetical dispute for which probabilities are calculated.
In the undirected data, values represent the average of the estimates for when Country A is the initiator and when Country A is the target.


\section{Correlates of War Data}

The DOE scores are calculated using two datasets from the Correlates of War project: the Militarized Interstate Disputes data, v4.01 \citep{Palmer:2015hp} and the National Material Capabilities data, v4.0 \citep{singer1972}.

\subsection{data-mida-4.01.csv and data-midb-4.01.csv}

The file \texttt{data-mida-4.01.csv} contains the dispute-level Militarized Interstate Disputes data.
The file \texttt{data-midb-4.01.csv} contains the dispute-participant--level data.
Their codebook is appended to the end of this document.

\subsection{data-nmc-4.0.csv}

The file \texttt{data-nmc-4.0.csv} contains the National Material Capabilities data.
Its codebook is appended to the end of this document.

\section{YAML Metadata}

Metadata about the models used for training and about the replication studies are contained in YAML format.
These metadata were written and produced by the authors of the manuscript.

\subsection{metadata-models.yml}

Each observation is one of the component models of the super learner used to calculate the DOE scores.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{name}: Unique identifier.
  \item \texttt{method}: Descriptive name for the model.
  \item \texttt{data}: Which variables were used to train the model.
  \item \texttt{year}: Whether a time trend is included in the model.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{metadata-replications.yml}

Each observation is one of the studies reanalyzed in the replication analysis.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{name}: Unique identifier.
  \item \texttt{author}: Last names of authors.
  \item \texttt{year}: Year of publication.
  \item \texttt{journal}: Journal of publication.
  \item \texttt{citekey}: BibTeX citation key.
  \item \texttt{repeats}: Number of repetitions used in the cross-validation analysis.
  \item \texttt{method}: Statistical model used in the analysis (logit, probit, etc.).
  \item \texttt{units}: Unit of observation in the analysis.
  \item \texttt{terms\_cinc}: Which functions of CINC scores were included in the original analysis.
  \item \texttt{terms\_doe}: Which functions of DOE scores were included in the reanalysis.
  \item \texttt{dv}: Dependent variable in the analysis.
  \item \texttt{null\_hypothesis}: Main substantive null hypothesis (or hypotheses) in the analysis.
